**Modeling Assignment 1 : Variety Expansion Models** 

******
#Introduction

** Model 1 is built on the assumption that final output is used as an
R&D input. The intuition behind the model is that the final good is used
for consumption and investment. Its only other use is in producing
intermediate products. So, the economy’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is
final output $ Y_t $ minus the amount used in intermediate production.

** In the alternative model, Model 2 , a fraction of Labor, $ L_1 $ is used in
the production of final goods, and the other fraction, $ L_2 $ is
allocated for research activities directed towards increasing variety.

****
#Source of Difference

The most fundamental difference between Model 1 and Model 2 comes from
the source of input used for production of intermediate products (the
R&D input). A portion of output R is used as R&D input in Model 1,
whereas a fraction of Labor $ L_2 $ is the R&D input in second model.

Because of the fundamental differences mentioned above, the first model
has the whole Labor L in its output equation whereas, only $ L_1 $ is
seen in Model 2 because the rest of the population $ L_2 $ is in R&D
instead of output production. Thus, the two models differ mostly in
terms of the labor term.

**Let’s compare outputs in the two models**

#Output

The final goods’ output in Model 1 is given by:-

$$Y_t = L^{1-\alpha}\int_{0}^{M_t}x_i^{\alpha}dx$$

Or,

$$Y_t = L^{1-\alpha} \sum_{i=1}^{M_t} x_i^{\alpha}$$

The final goods’ output in Model 2 is given by:-

$$Y_t = L_1^{1-\alpha}\int_{0}^{M_t}x_i^{\alpha}dx$$

Or,

$$Y_t = (L-L_R)^{1-\alpha} \sum_{i=1}^{M_t} x_i^{\alpha}$$

****

#Intermediate Products

The amount of intermediate products used in Model 1 is given by :-

$x = L \alpha ^ \frac {2} {1-\alpha}$

Or,

$ Y = (ML_y)^{1-\alpha} (s_x Y)^{\alpha} $

The amount of intermediate products used in Model 2 is given by :-

$x = L_1 \alpha ^ {\frac {2} {(1-\alpha)}}$

Or,

$ Y = M(L-L_R)s_x^ {\frac{\alpha}{(1-\alpha)}} $

****
#Rate of innovation

The rate at which the variety expands, that is, the rate of innovation
for Model 1 is given by :-

$$\frac{dM_t}{dt}=\lambda R_t$$

Or,

$\dot{M}=\lambda R  $

The rate at which the variety expands, that is, the rate of innovation
for Model 2 is given by :-

$$\frac{dM_t}{dt}=\lambda M_t L_2$$

Or,

$\dot{M}=\lambda_L M L_R  $

****
#Profits

The profits for innovation sector in Model 1 is given by:-

$ \pi = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}L \alpha^{\frac {2}{1-\alpha}} $

The profits for innovation sector in Model 2 is given by:-

$ \pi = \frac{1-\alpha}{\alpha}L_1 \alpha^{\frac {2}{1-\alpha}} $

****
#Interest Rate
The rate of return for Model 1 is given by :-

$r = \lambda\alpha L(1-\alpha)s_x^{\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}}$

The rate of return for Model 2 is given by :-

$r = \lambda_L\alpha (L-\frac {g}{\lambda_L})$

****
#Growth Rate
The growth rate for Model 1 is given by :-

$$g = \frac{\lambda \frac{1-\alpha} {\alpha} L\alpha^{\frac {2} {1-\alpha}}-\rho } {\varepsilon}$$

The growth rate for Model 2 is given by :-

$$g = \frac{\alpha \lambda L - \rho}{\alpha + \varepsilon}$$

Growth and interest rate in response to parameter shocks

****
#Additional Comments

The effect of change in preferences $ (\rho $ and $ \varepsilon) $
showed following characteristics over the two models :-

-   Increasing growth rate needs more effort in Labor R&D Model than Lab
    Equipment Model as shown by the response of growth rate to
    parameter shocks.

<!-- -->

-   Returns on innovation (interest rates) are independent of growth
    rate for Lab Equipment Model whereas returns on innovation dropped
    in Labor R&D Model when growth rates increased.

<!-- -->

-   The response of growth rates to parameter shocks was as expected.
    The growth rates changed in the same direction.

The effect of change in initial condition $(\lambda)$

-   The growth rates changed in both directions, but the effect was
    bigger for Lab Equipment Model.

The effect of change in $ \alpha $

-   The change in $ \alpha $ changed the growth rates in different
    direction, decreasing growth rate for Lab Equipment Model, while
    increasing growth rate for Labor R&D model.

****
#Conclusion

-   The models behaved differently with respect to different parameter
    shocks because of the difference in inputs used for R&D between
    two models.

-   Both models have the prospects of unbounded growth
